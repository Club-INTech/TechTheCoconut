checksum.exe is an executable that can be used to add checksum data
to a binary image, which can be used by the bootloader to determine
that the image is valid.

You will only need the copy of checksum.exe from this directory
if your version of the Code Red tools does not already have it 
installed.

For more information please see the main 
RDB1768cmsis_usb_bootloader "readme.txt".
